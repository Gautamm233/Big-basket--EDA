# BigBasket EDA Project

This is a data analysis project I worked on using a dataset from BigBasket. The goal was to explore product categories, brand performance, sales trends, discounts, and customer ratings through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## 📝 About the Dataset
- Total rows: 27,555
- Columns: 10
- Features include: Product, Category, Sub-Category, Brand, Sale Price, Market Price, Discount, Rating

---

## 🔍 What I Did in This Project
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values and outliers
- Used bar charts, scatter plots, boxplots, and histograms to explore trends
- Analyzed which brands and categories have the most products and sales
- Looked at the effect of discounts and prices on customer ratings

---

## 📊 Some Key Findings
- "Beauty & Hygiene" is the top category in terms of product count
- "Fresho" and "BB Home" are strong performing brands
- No clear link between discount and rating — product quality matters more
- Most product ratings are 4 or higher, showing customers are happy

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📌 Final Thoughts
This project helped me get better at EDA, working with real datasets, and finding useful business insights. I’ll continue improving and learning from real-world data like this.

Thanks for checking it out!
